                            <b>A private infrastructure industry</b> is emerging with a simple message to the public agencies that have traditionally dominated the industry: allow us to provide a complete package of development services and we will deliver the facilities needed in less time and at little or no cost to the treasury. The pitch is compelling. Hundreds of projects costing billions of dollars have been completed using predominantly private capital in the last fifteen years. Most of the new investment created by unlocking private capital has been built in developing countries where the potential benefits of modern infrastructure are greatest.

                            Public-private partnerships help fill the "infrastructure gap" between infrastructure needs and in-place facilities by exploiting a previously untapped source of capital. Applying private capital to needed infrastructure allows the public sector to complete more projects sooner than would be possible using only scarce public resources, and to divert resources to other projects, including those with less ability to attract private finance. For the private sector, investing in infrastructure projects is a potentially lucrative use for large blocks of capital. The public gains access to a higher capacity and in many cases more efficient, infrastructure system.

                        In this manner, a government or municipality acquires at virtually no cost a facility that it would otherwise have had to finance, build, and maintain itself. When public-private partnerships provide infrastructure gratis that the government would have eventually had to finance through tax revenues or other fees, public-private partnerships replace taxation with privately collected user fees or other forms of remuneration to pay for the infrastructure.
Infrastructure assets, especially newly constructed assets, tend to be long-lived, require minimal maintenance, capital expenditure and are generally not subject to major technological change or physical deterioration. This generally means that significant cash flow is often available from
infrastructure businesses to service debt, make distributions to shareholders or expand the business, or all three.

                        As a third sector company, we are strongly committed to the Sub-Saharan Continent and believe its time Africans rethink their approaches to developing our infrastructures. As populations grow and our cities become more crowded than ever, low cost public and private housing has become an increasingly important issue for our governments. However, we deeply believe low cost social housing should no longer be limited to characterless blocks of concrete. ANL aim is to facilitate the provision of extremely affordable low-cost housing to low income individuals and families who need it – while still affording them the dignity of well-designed and distinctive homes

                        Rural-urban migration is embryonic to the sprawling deplorable shanty towns and shack dwellers in overcrowded Nigerian cities and other parts of Africa. There is an ever increasing demand for affordable housing, light industrial parks, warehouses, modern markets and shopping plazas.
With a $250,000,000 industry first bond we’re proud to be part of the Africa’s construction innovation team, creating smarter ways to help people work together, generating more value at every level, and building a better world for everyone.
