                          Food Insecurity in Africa and Nigeria
Africa as a whole cannot currently feed itself; its share of world trade has halved in a generation
Nigeria is vulnerable to the global food crisis despite its oil wealth
Nigeria is a net importer of agricultural produce - $4.2 Billion pa including Wheat, Fish, Rice and Sugar
Agriculture accounts for 40% of Nigeria’s GDP and 60% of Employment
Since the 1960’s Nigeria lost a dominant position in exports of key crops such as groundnuts, ground nut oil, palm oil and Rice.
The consequence is Nigeria faces a large and growing global agricultural market.
Given our access to over $2billion Foreign Direct Investible funds for agribusinesses, our strategy is to create an intervention in the Value Chain: Input Producers, Farmers, Agro Dealers, Agro Processors, Industrial Manufacturers and Trade/Exports.
