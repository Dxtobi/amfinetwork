                         In 2016 our organisation initiated a renewable energy project development business model which is based on identifying local energy needs, sourcing the international expertise, technology and financing to deliver the most cost efficient solutions that create local capacity building and job opportunities.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                         Our mission is to bring renewable energy to Nigeria and West African sub-region to enable development and growth through associated projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We do this by using concepts and opportunity to build the structure and foundations needed to deliver programmes that can be implemented, are financially viable and ready to go. We facilitate local and international; PPP that addresses the energy and growth needs of communities in Africa, in a sustainable manner, with particular focus on the blend of agriculture and renewable energy at the heart of our agenda.

                        <h3>
                            Rationale
                        </h3>
                        In a growing world, where the conventional forms of energy are fast moving towards extinction as well as are contributing generously to global
                        concerns like the  <a href='"http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/GreenHouseEffect.php"'> Green House Effect</a> 
                        greenhouse effect and <a href='http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/GlobalWarmingCauses.php'> Global Warming Causes</a> global warming, the need to innovate and employ alternate or unconventional <a href="http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/EnergySources.php">Energy Sources</a> energy sources has become crucial for the existence of our future. Waste-to-Energy, also widely recognized by its acronym WtE is the generation of energy in the form of heat or electricity from waste. (The process is also called Energy from waste to EfW). Using fully developed and patented technology,
                        we can utilize many millions of tons of household and industrial waste to generate a continuing supply of electricity 24/7 365 days per year.
                        
                        <br/>

                        Each year millions of tons of waste are produced. Inevitably they become a part of landfill.
                        This causes huge environmental impact in terms of wildlife, ecosystems and to human health.
                        Nigeria in particular and West African sub-Region in general has a significant problem with
                        waste and also a significant problem with continuous and reliable power source.
                        Energy from waste offers recovery of energy by conversion of non-recyclable materials
                        through various processes primarily using thermal technologies. Energy that is produced in the form of electricity,
                        heat or fuel using combustion, depolymerisation and gasification is clean and
                        renewable energy with reduced <a href="http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/CarbonFootPrintCalculator.php">carbon</a>   
                        emissions and minimal environmental impact. This places these energy sources at the forefront of clean energy production.
                        How We Produce Energy from Waste
                        Waste treatments that are conducted involving high temperatures are called Thermal treatment.
                        The heat generated from this thermal temperature is then used to create energy. Several countries in the world,
                        especially in Europe are currently using Incineration as an alternate means of energy production; United Kingdom, Sweden,
                        Germany and Luxembourg to name a few.
                        Thermal Technologies:
                        Depolymerisation uses thermal decomposition where in the presence of water, the organic compounds are heated at high temperatures.
                        This process of thermal decomposition is called Hydrous Pyrolysis in scientific terms. The process without the use of oxygen is called Pyrolysis.
                        Derived from Greek it is literally the synthesis of the terms, Fire and Separation. The process usually takes plastic and bio-mass as their primary ingredients.
                        The rest works as a thermal chemical decomposition.
                        This is again conducted at high temperatures and involves parallel changes of the chemical
                        composition and physics often said to be a replication or representation of the conditions under which fossil
                        fuels are created, depolymerisation has its own sets of benefits and limitations.
                        Gasification is the process employed for waste to energy generation.
                        Gasification converts carbonaceous substances into carbon dioxide, carbon mono oxide and some amount of hydrogen.
                        This process like incineration employs high temperatures to obtain results,
                        however the major difference is that combustion does not occur by “burning” the material.
                        Steam and/or oxygen are also used in this procedure where usually fossil fuels or organic substances are used.
                        The gas that is produced from the whole procedure is called Synthesis gas and is considered as a good means of
                        <a href="http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/AlternativeEnergySources.php">alternate energy.</a> 
                        Syngas is there after used for heat and electricity production primarily among other uses.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis">Pyrolysis</a>  is another waste to energy process,
                        used majorly in industrial processes. Pyrolysis is just like Hydrous pyrolysis, without the use of oxygen.
                        Pyrolysis employs agricultural waste or organic waste from industries.
                        The Syngas produced from the waste material is used to power generators
                        and therefore supply a consistent electricity supply.
                        It is estimated that utilising the available household and
                        industrial waste in Niger state we could construct and
                        operate a minimum of 2500 MW electricity plant within 18-24
                        month period
