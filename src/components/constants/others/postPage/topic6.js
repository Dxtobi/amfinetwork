                         <h3 className='subHeading'>Background</h3> 
At the 2000 Millennium Summit, 189 Member States of the United Nations endorsed theMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a framework to fight poverty and to accelerate
Human  Development.  Most of the constraints being faced by Developing Economies towards scaling up interventions for better results are found at the policy level and also known to
include weak sectoral strategies, planning and budgeting; poor linkages between the various sectors and national development strategy, as well as the failure of States / National policies
and plans to adequately address inequalities in access to funding and development services especially at the sub-national level.
<br />
                            <br/>
                            Building on the above, Amfi Network Limited works in collaboration with her partners in organising  International Investment and Funding Conferences, Capacity Building Workshops and Training on Investment opportunities in Nigeria. These events are targeted at accessing funding for Agricultural Development, Micro-financing, Mass Housing Development, Small & Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) towards sustainable Rural Development in Nigeria.

Our conferences and training workshops are designed to go beyond the traditional practice of bringing together participants to conference venues. They seek to create an avenue for a realistic and objective appraisal of potentials for fast growing economies in Africa in order to attract  investors to invest - especially in Development Financing for Small Scale Industries, Agriculture, Micro Finance Lending, Renewable Energy, Construction and  Housing.
Objectives:

The core objectives of our events lies in our firm belief that, whilst Nigeria and other African countries have made significant strides in courting investors both from a political perspective, it is recognised that the vast investment opportunities that exist in Agriculture, Rural Housing, Renewable Energy and SME's sector of the economies will only be fully realised once perceptions in the minds of prospective investors and international funding agencies concerning the challenges towards offering an enabling investment climate has been fully addressed.
<br />
                            <br/>
They are also design to address these challenges in relation to a conducive environment so as to attract more Foreign Direct Investment towards development and economic growth.
<br />
                            <br/>
With over 100 Investors across Europe, America and Asia usually attending our investment conferences, we approach the subject of investing not just in Nigeria but also from a standpoint which gives confidence to investors in Developing Economies by clearly demonstrating that a market-based approach to sustainable and value chain capacity building framework strategy is the best way forward.

It is recognised that the current status quo which includes significant Aid and Charity based programmes cannot alone provide the mechanism for poverty alleviation and achievement of set development goals.
<br />
                            <br/>
It is our belief that a strategy is required which includes specific goals for moving communities up the value chain, for supporting the current SDGs targets and for assisting the private sector in achieving its stated objectives.

Furthermore, our conferences and workshops always focus on a strategy which is market-based and not one which is purely constructed from an intellectual perspective as so often is. It focuses on practicalities to address the 'how' in terms of executing an effective implementation plan and the sustenance of effective Public Private Partnership arrangements.
<br />
                            <br/>
Our aim here is to demonstrate - examples of best practices - where this commitment is forthcoming and its positive impact on developing economies. We also look at the opportunities for private sector enterprises to progress and playa more active part in Nigeria in terms of creating their own standards of corporate governance and ethics as we adhere to the slogan
“whilst Business cannot solve poverty, poverty will not be solved without Businesses”
                            <br />
                            <br/>
We have also recognised that in many Developed Countries SMEs account for anything up to 50% of GDP whilst in Africa this rarely raises much above 10%. Our events are designed to discuss various strategies for the implementation of solutions to this significant issue by developing entrepreneurial activities and creating incentives for enterprise to move to the formal economy thus achieving the objectives of wealth and employment creation which is consistent with the overall objectives of the SDGs.

Amfi Network Limited in collaboration with its Technical and Financial Partners, ROLT INTERNATIONAL initiate and create partnerships in the electricity, development, training and commodity sectors in Africa.
