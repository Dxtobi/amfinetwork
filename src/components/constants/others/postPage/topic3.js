                             As a company we are simple but extremely ambitious. We are ambitiously looking at joining the ranks of indigenous independent Upstream and Downstream production oil companies in Nigeria and Africa with a vision to power Africa’s emerging and growing oil and gas sector. To achieve this, we are implementing ambitious investment partnership programmes across the entire petroleum value chain, capitalising on the breadth of our team’s experience and our extensive knowledge of the regions in which we will operate. In 2016 we partnered with Association of African Petroleum Organisation to host the maiden edition of Nigerian Petroleum Summit to replicate similar events in other parts of the world such as OTC in North America.
